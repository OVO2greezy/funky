          Egypt may be known for ancient treasures and rich history, but there
          is more to this nation than you might expect. From surreal waters and
          golden sand beaches to remarkable architecture and natural therapies,
          Egypt is worthy of your bucket list. Here are some of the top reasons
          Egypt should be your next destination. <br />Ancient Egypt is one of
          the most interesting and oldest civilisations in the world. The Great
          Pyramids of Giza, the only surviving ancient wonder, along with
          ancient Egyptian statues and tombs, continue to seize the attention of
          top archaeologists and, of course, the wider world. To this day,
          remains of the ancient Egyptian civilization continue to be
          discovered.

          The southernmost tip of Africa is one of the most magnificent parts of
          the world, a paradise full of exquisite scenery, beautiful beaches,
          two oceans – the icy Atlantic and the warmer Indian Ocean – and a wide
          variety of attractions to make any holiday-maker happy. This is where
          Cape Town is located. They call it ‘the Fairest Cape’, and there’s a
          reason for this. It really is a magical city, with flat-topped Table
          Mountain looming over it. It stretches around the mountain, and
          wherever you are, there are often glimpses of sea and golden beaches,
          not to mention that iconic mountain as its beautiful backdrop.

          Flying solo? Make your home base Kauai’s Hanalei Town on the island’s
          North Shore. The small town is famous for its crescent-shaped beach
          and has a friendly, laid-back vibe, where travelers and locals come
          for the excellent surfing and on-point restaurants. Start the day with
          a surf lesson from Hawaiian Surfing Adventures, which will get even
          the biggest rookies riding waves. When hunger strikes, head to Hanalei
          Taro & Juice Co.’s food truck for farm-to-table Hawaiian fare like
          kalua pig, poi, lomi salmon, and smoothies made from taro ⎯ a local,
          heart-shaped root vegetable sourced from Hanalei’s misty green
          mountains. <br />Food and cultural festivals are everywhere on the Big
          Island. The Kona region is known for its coffee production, and
          celebrates the history behind the bean during the annual Kona Coffee
          Cultural Festival. This event typically takes place in November and
          includes coffee farm tours, coffee and tea pairing events, and the
          Holualoa Village Coffee & Art Stroll, which takes visitors through the
          art enclave of Holualoa. The island also hosts the Merrie Monarch
          Festival in spring, when hula schools from every island come together
          to perform. In the fall, the Hawaii Food and Wine Festival draws top
          chefs from around the world for a week full of drinking and dining. To
          stay up to date, be sure to check festival websites for any schedule
          changes or updates that may impact your plans.
